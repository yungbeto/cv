            Cavnue is on a mission to bridge the gap between current autonomous

          </p>
          <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
            When I was brought on to the product team, our main goal was to take
            the overwhelming amount of valuable data generated by Cavnue's
            hardware system and surface it in a way that was valuable to our end
            user.
          </p>
          <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
            For my part I lead the design of a dashboard that not only provided
            valuable insight to a user, but also telegraphed the accuracy of a
            given data point, thereby instilling a level of confidence that
            Cavnue's tech is not only powerful but reliable.
          </p>
          <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
            My work resulted in moving away from third party tools, saving the
            company valuable capital, and laying the groundwork for ensuring the
            tools we built foregrounded data transparency and fostered a high
            level of trust from our users.

            Worked closely with stakeholders to research and develop not only
            specific user personas and their respective requirements, but design
            a set of features that targets specific needs.

            week-long design sprint that helped us identify who were our core

            how we could efficiently service them.

            Once we had a clear idea of whom we were building for and what might
            constitute their needs I along with the rest of the team began a
            process of meticulously documenting our findings in order to share

            We took it upon ourselves as the product team to steer the direction

          <p>
            As with any design project I iterated through countless wireframes
            in order to narrow down the scope of the project. As I did this I
            continuously checked in with engineering stakeholders to make sure
            all features stayed within the realm of possibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major forcing function of our design process was the fact that the
            hardware specs were being worked through concurrently with the
            front-end designs meaning each work stream was influencing the
            other.

          <p>
            Eventually we landed on an MVP design that accounted for a strong
            foundational solution that accounted for a core set of features that
            occupied a sweet spot of user needs and technical limitations.

            The solution included live and archival views of incoming data

          The passenger tablet provided an engaging value proposition and
          memorable product distinction. The tablet could have benefited from
          taking more time to QA before our initial release, however, that was a
          compromise we consciously made to meet an aggressive deadline.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ultimately, due to regulatory circumstances out of our control, we
          were forced to sunset the tablet. However, during its brief tenure,
          the tablet generated high engagement numbers and, I believe, could
          have proven to be a very valuable customer touchpoint had it had more
          time to mature.
