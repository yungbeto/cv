        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>
          In spring of 2021 Revel launched its rideshare program with a fleet of
          signature-blue Tesla Model Ys. As a way to differentiate their program
          from competitors, a consumer-facing tablet was installed in every
          backseat. I led design on the tablet’s interface and collaborated
          closely with a small team of engineers and product stakeholders.

            From the beginning of the project we knew we needed to give our
            passengers the ability to control music during their trip. A major
            determining factor through the process was dealing with third party
            music providers. Not knowing enough about music streaming platform
            APIs we assumed initially we’d go through a service like Spotify.
            However since we were pressed with many operational hurdles and an
            aggressive deadline our lead engineer made the executive decision to
            use free streaming radio feeds for our music choices.

          <h2>In the hot seat</h2>
          <p>
            As I began researching for this feature it became clear that the
            efficacy of seat warmer controls, especially digital controls,
            hinged on the interface’s relationship with the seat itself. A
            traditional analog control has the advantage of being placed in
            proximity to whichever seat its controlling. A digital control,
            however, has the extra work of making absolutely clear which seat
            it’s meant to heat. For the initial release we overlaid the heating
            controls on top of an image of the back row of seats in the hopes
            that the passenger will visually intuit which button controls which
            seat.

            We built an ad hoc weather widget for the tablet to offer a subtle
            touch on-brand experience. It was a great opportunity to create a
            fun set of weather icons.

        <h6>Results</h6>
        <p>
          The passenger tablet provided an engaging value proposition and
          memorable product distinction. The tablet could have benefited from
          taking more time to QA before our initial release, however, that was a
          compromise we consciously made to meet an aggressive deadline.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ultimately, due to regulatory circumstances out of our control, we
          were forced to sunset the tablet. However, during its brief tenure,
          the tablet generated high engagement numbers and, I believe, could
          have proven to be a very valuable customer touchpoint had it had more
          time to mature.
