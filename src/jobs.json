    "CompanyIcon": "src/img/companyIcons/companyIcon_revel.png",
    "JobDescription": "I joined Revel as their first designer in the Summer of 2019 - a pivotal time in the company's growth. I was tasked with designing a full suite of internal tools that would allow the company to bring all their operations and logistics in-house. I worked closely with nearly every department lead in the company to ensure that the tools we built met the needs of all who'd be using it. As a result, once we released the tools, we saw a huge spike in productivity and financial efficiency. In addition to internal tools, I was a key stakeholder on a number of user-facing, high-revenue initiatives. For example, I led design for a unique, passenger facing tablet in the run-up to the launch of Revel's rideshare program in an effort to rise above the existing players in the market, flexing our position as a car-service provider that owned the end to end experience. I also designed the sign-up, purchase funnel, and user dashboard experience for Revel's electric bike rental program.",
