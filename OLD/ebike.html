      <h1>Revel’s Electric Bike Subscription Program</h1>
      <p>
        Revel rolled out a pilot electric bike subscription program and for my part I designed the onboarding, purchase
        funnel, and dashboard for Revel’s mobile app.

        <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
          By 2020 Revel had firmly established itself as NYC's premeire solution to last-mile mobility through it's
          network of shared mopeds - but the company had larger aspirations. Cavnue was looking into ways to branch
          farther out into the world of electric mobility.
        </p>
        <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
          It was decided that we would embark on a pilot program to test the efficacy of an electric bike rental
          program. The idea was we would allow people in the NYC region to sign up and pay for a subscription plan that
          would give them access to a bike that we would deliver and maintain.
        </p>
        <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
          For my part I worked closely with the biz dev team and other product stakeholders to shape the scope of the
          project and how the user experience should play out. I also lead the design of the sign up, order funnel, and
          subscription dashboard.

        <p>
          We collaborated with
          <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a> on a
          week-long design sprint that helped us identify who were our core
          user personas as well as what constituted their specific needs and
          how we could efficiently service them.
        </p>
        <p>The process involved countless interviews with stakeholders in
          various industries surrounding vehicle travel and road maintenance.

        <p>
          Once we had a clear idea of whom we were building for and what they
          needed, I, along with the rest of the team, began a process of
          meticulously documenting our findings in order to share them with
          the rest of the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took it upon ourselves as the product team to steer the direction
          of the company’s efforts and keep the end user front of mind.

        <p>
          I iterated through countless wireframes in order to narrow down the
          scope of the project. As I did this I continuously checked in with
          engineering stakeholders to make sure all features stayed in scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major forcing function of our design process was the fact that the
          hardware specs were being worked through concurrently with the
          front-end designs.

        <p>
          Eventually we landed on an MVP design that accounted for a strong
          foundational solution that accounted for a core set of features that
          occupied a sweet spot of user needs and technical limitations.

          Upon release, the Cavanue Dashboard was a crucial step in proving
          the value prop of the company. It allowed outside stakeholders to
          understand the capabilities of a deployed system of sensors, it gave
          ML engineers a means to acquire crucial data without resorting to
          3rd party tools, and it allowed anyone with access to glean at a
          high level the overall health of the technology.
        </p>
        <p class="copyLarge textShadow">
          In many ways it served as a milestone for the company - proving the
          efficacy of Cavnue's mission.
